SourceClean is a tool that clean up #if/#ifdef/#ifndef in source code and make source code easier to read. Some projects need to run on different platforms. Through #ifdef, the software can be compiled with GCC into software suitable for different platforms or with different functions according to conditions.
We can preserve the compiled intermediate files by adding -save-temps=obj -fdirectives-only to the compile options. The intermediate files can be processed by SourceClean to generate source files with ifdef/ifndef removed to make the source code easier to read and understand.
